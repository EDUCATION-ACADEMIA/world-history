<strong>Concept note-1:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Spanish were able to defeat the Aztec and the Inca not only because they had horses, dogs, guns, and swords, but also because they brought with them germs that made many native Americans sick. Diseases like smallpox and measles were unknown among the natives; therefore, they had no immunity to them.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
