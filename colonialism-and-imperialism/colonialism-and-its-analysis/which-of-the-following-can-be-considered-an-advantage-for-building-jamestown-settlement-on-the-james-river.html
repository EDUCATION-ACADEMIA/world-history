<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Towards that goal, the site had two advantages. First, it was on a small peninsula surrounded by deep but marshy waters, making it difficult to attack by either foot or boat. It was also far inland from the ocean, and would stay under the radar from raiding Spanish or French ships. So, it was very defensible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Jamestown was surrounded by water on three sides (it was not fully an island yet) and was far inland; both meant it was easily defensible against possible Spanish attacks. The water was also deep enough that the English could tie their ships at the shoreline-good parking!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Jamestown was located as close to the Atlantic Ocean as the initial colonial leaders thought was safe, rather than as far inland as ships could go, in order to balance military security with the logistics of getting back and forth to England.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-1607 Jamestown Settlement Founded Led by Captain John Smith, early English settlers established a colony at Jamestown in 1607. The English chose Jamestown Island, 60 miles from the sea, because it could be defended against the Spanish, and its deep water allowed sailing ships near shore.
