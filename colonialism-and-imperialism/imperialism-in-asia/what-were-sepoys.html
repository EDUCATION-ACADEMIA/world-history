<title>What were Sepoys?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Causes of the Rebellion The main causes of the Sepoy Mutiny may be summarised as: Sepoys were unhappy with the pay inequality compared to British soldiers. Sepoys were suspicious that rifle cartridges used animal fats they could not touch as part of their religious beliefs.The sepoys felt that the British did not respect their religion and this was a major reason for their mutiny in 1857 that prompted the Great Rebellion. In April 1857, during the Great Rebellion, 85 sepoys refused to use the new cartridges which they felt were unclean. The 85 sepoys were court-martialled and imprisoned.Sepoys were Indian soldiers employed within European military garrisons to provide the much-needed manpower for the defence of European colonies in Asia. The term sepoy is derived from the Persian word sipahi, which had been translated into the Urdu and Hindi languages as a generic term for soldier.">
