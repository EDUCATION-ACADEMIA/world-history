<strong> How were Japan and China economically different from each other by the end of the 19th century? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Japan’s economy was growing steadily because it remained isolated from the rest of the world, while China’s economy remained weak because it had opened itself up to the influence of imperial countries. 
</p>
<p>(B) China’s economy profited from the country’s colonization of other parts of Asia, while Japan’s economy remained stagnant because its army was weak and could not be sent to establish colonies. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Japan was a successfully industrialized country with a sizable army and a strong economy, while China’s economy remained weak and vulnerable to the interferences of imperial countries. 
</p>
<p>(D) China became economically strong because it accepted Western influences and trade agreements, while Japan remained economically weak because of its refusal to abandon its policy of isolationism.
