He led the Red Shirts, an army who wore bright red shirts into battle. They captured the island of Sicily and then crossed into the Italian mainland. They conquered Southern areas and agreed to unite with Piedmont-Sardinia in the north.In 1860 CE, a large number of armed volunteers called Red Shirts led by Guiseppe Garibaldi entered South Italy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.
