It emphasized the position of the colonists that they were being unfairly taxed and did not have proper representation as Englishmen in the British Parliament.The Stamp Act Congress met on this day in New York in 1765, a meeting that led nine Colonies to declare the English Crown had no right to tax Americans who lacked representation in British Parliament.">
