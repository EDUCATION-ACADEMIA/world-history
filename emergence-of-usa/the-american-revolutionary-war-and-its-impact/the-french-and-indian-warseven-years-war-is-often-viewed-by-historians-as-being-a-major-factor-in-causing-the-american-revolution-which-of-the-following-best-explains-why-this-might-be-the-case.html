</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Based on this passage, what is the BEST reason why the French and Indian War (Seven Years’ War) led to the American revolution? The colonists had to pay more money for land due to high taxes passed after the French &amp; Indian War.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:

<strong>Concept note-3:
