<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-One of the first issues that came up at the Estates General was how they would vote. The king said that each estate would vote as a body (each estate would get 1 vote). The members of the Third Estate did not like this. It meant that they could always be outvoted by the much smaller First and Second Estates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Estates-General of 1789 was a general assembly representing the French estates of the realm summoned by Louis XVI to propose solutions to Franceâ€™s financial problems. It ended when the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, signaling the outbreak of the French Revolution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The middle class and peasants were angered by the tax structure; the First and Second Estates were not forced to pay taxes, leaving the depressed French economy to fall upon the Third Estate. Before the revolution, France was governed by an absolute monarch, and, for matters of taxation, the Estates General.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The Estates-General met at Versailles on May 5, 1789. They were immediately divided over a fundamental issue: should they vote by head, giving the advantage to the Third Estate, or by estate, in which case the two privileged orders of the realm might outvote the third?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Estates-General of 1789 ended in failure because the Third Estate (commoners) refused to accept the decision made by majority vote where the First Estate (aristocracy) and Second Estate (clergy) voted together to put the bulk of the taxation responsibilities on the shoulders of commoners.
