Samuel Adams helped organize the group in Boston. This group sometimes used violence to frighten tax collectors. Many colonial courts shut down because people refused to buy the stamps required for legal documents.So, under the direction of the Sons of Liberty, the colonists organized a boycott of all British goods being sold in the colonies.
