<strong> Why did Abyssinia show that the League had failed (pick 4)? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** One of the League’s most important members, Italy, had gone against the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Britain and France showed they were more interested in their own welfare than protecting the Covenant of the League. 
</p>
<p>(C) It showed that the League were not listened to by other powers. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Small countries now knew that the League would not protect them from invasion and dictators, like Hitler and Mussolini, realised the League was powerless to stop them. 
<a id='x1-7r5'>
</a>
</p>
<p>(E) ** The League had shown that not only could it not deal with instances far away, but it also couldn’t deal with those closer to home with Europe.
