<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Voting Practices The Third Estate was upset over this, so the King allowed them to have 600 delegates. But they still had only 1 vote. The Third Estate wanted to vote by head, since they could outnumber the First and Second Estate delegates with their size &amp; the support of the poor parish priests &amp; liberal nobles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-King Louis XVI, aware of the injustices of the French tax policy, tried to reform the tax code to make it more fair, but was repeatedly thwarted by the overrepresented nobles and clergy. This angered the Third Estate, which refused to vote in the Estates General, and formed instead the National Assembly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Third Estate wanted the estates to meet as one body and for each delegate to have one vote. The other two estates, while having their own grievances against royal absolutism, believed – correctly, as history was to prove – that they stood to lose more power to the Third Estate than they stood to gain from the King.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The Third Estate was frustrated at the Estates General meeting in 1789 because that Estate represented the interests of the common people, and these were at odds with the interests of the elites of the First and Second Estates.
