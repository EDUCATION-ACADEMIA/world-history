<meta name="description" content="The Estates-General met at Versailles on May 5, 1789. They were immediately divided over a fundamental issue: should they vote by head, giving the advantage to the Third Estate, or by estate, in which case the two privileged orders of the realm might outvote the third?Answer and Explanation: Several key issues arose when Louis XVI called the Estates General to meet in 1789. First, the Estates General and King Louis XVI could not agree on what tax reform should look like. This caused bitterness between both sides, and the Estates General came to distrust the kings intentions.One of the first issues that came up at the Estates General was how they would vote. The king said that each estate would vote as a body (each estate would get 1 vote). The members of the Third Estate did not like this. It meant that they could always be outvoted by the much smaller First and Second Estates.Each Estate in the Estates General received one vote as a whole group. The First and Second Estates often agreed on issues and would out-vote the Third Estate, two to one.Summoned by King Louis XVI, the Estates General of 1789 ended when the Third Estate formed the National Assembly and, against the wishes of the King, invited the other two estates to join. This signaled the outbreak of the French Revolution.">
