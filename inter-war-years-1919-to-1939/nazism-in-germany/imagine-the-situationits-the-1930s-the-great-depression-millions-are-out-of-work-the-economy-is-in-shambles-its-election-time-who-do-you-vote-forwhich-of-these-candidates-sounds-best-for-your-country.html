<strong> Imagine the situation:It’s the 1930’s, the Great Depression. Millions are out of work; the economy is in shambles. It’s election time, who do you vote for?Which of these candidates sounds best for your country. 
</strong>
<p>(A) I have a drinking habit. I briefly served in the navy, but had an office post during the last war. I think military force should be sent often to other countries to force favorable change. In my speeches, I’m frequently defiant and rude. 
</p>
<p>(B) My relatives have all held high political office, &amp; my family is very wealthy. I’m a womanizer, and my policy proposals are clearly self-serving. I suffer from ailing health (though I hide it from the public). 
</p>
<p>(C) ** I served in the military and earned medals in the last war. I do not drink but practice a healthy lifestyle. I want to make a stable economy with more opportunity for commonfolk.
