<meta name="description" content="The Viet Congs surprise attacks were often carried out by ambushing American soldiers and then escaping before being captured. This is referred to as a hit-and-run ambush. This was possible because many times those carrying out the warfare would disguise themselves as regular citizens or local farmers.The basic aim of guerrilla warfare is to avoid a pitched battle with the enemy. The Vietcong used this as they could never hope to defeat the might of US forces in a battle. Their aim was to attack US troops in small groups, and then disappear into the surrounding countryside.Although working in conjunction with the North Vietnamese government and military, the Viet Cong often used a variety of guerrilla tactics against American forces, including hit-and-run maneuvers, surprise attacks, and soldiers disguised as civilians.They would frustrate the Americans by simple tactics: retreating when the enemy attacked; raiding enemy camps; attacking the enemy when they were tired and pursuing the enemy when they retreated. The Vietcong made sure they picked battles they would be able to win.Guerrilla tactics are on intelligence, ambush, deception, sabotage, and espionage, undermining an authority through long, low-intensity confrontation. It can be quite successful against an unpopular foreign or local regime, as demonstrated by the Cuban Revolution, Afghanistan War and Vietnam War.">
