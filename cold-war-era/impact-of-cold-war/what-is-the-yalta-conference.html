<strong> What is the Yalta Conference? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** This was held from February 7 to 11, 1945, was the World War II meeting of the heads of government of the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union 
</p>
<p>(B) in November Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt for the first time. The Red Army had just begun to push the Germans back after the Battle of Stalingrad, the Germans had been forced out of Africa, Italy had been invaded and America had halted the Japanese in the Pacific. In more confident mood, the Big Three made it clear that they had one aim:the destruction of Germany and Japan. 
</p>
<p>(C) After the German surrender in July 1945 the Big Three met again in Potsdam, just outside Berlin. The main representatives were Stalin, Truman (Roosevelt’s successor as President of the USA) and Churchill (who was then replaced by Clement Attlee after the Labour victory in the British general election of 1945). The conference revealed a distinct cooling-off in the relations between East and West.

<p>(D) None of the above
